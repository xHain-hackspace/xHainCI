# HEX Stickers
This is an assortment of xHain stickers in the shape of an hexagon for events we have been visiting. The goal is to follow the design guide of each event and create a new sticker for people to add to their laptops etc. The order of the list is in order of creation date. 

## xHain Logo
It started with this sticker, ahexagonal representation of the xHain logo - designed for 37th chaos communication congress, but without following the design guide.

## 37C3 - unlocked
This sticker follows the 37th congress, with the unlocked theme and design guide that used dithering and a minimal color range. By using a holographic sticker foil, we achieve more colors.

## 38C3 - Illegal Instructions
Readability of the pillowhead font is limited, but xHain is stated on one of the corners anyways.

## 36C3 - Resource Exhaustion
Used here is the hope theme, allowing to use the green and some leaves in the sticker design. The big letters were generated with the official generator and then imported and spread in the hexagon.
